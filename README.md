The Contract Monthly Claim System is a C# application designed to streamline and automate the process of calculating, managing, and generating monthly claims for contract-based employees. The system ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and provides a structured way to track work hours, rates, and payouts. From Part 2, I made changes based on the lecturer’s feedback, such as adding a separate Manager tab and ensuring that each role in the system is fully separated with its own view and permissions. I then continued with Part 3 by automating several new features. I implemented the Lecturer View Automation by enabling automatic payment calculations and adding validation checks to ensure accurate claim submissions. I also automated the Coordinator and Manager processes by introducing rule-based verification workflows that make approving or rejecting claims faster and more reliable. Finally, I enhanced the HR View by automating claim summaries and report generation, allowing HR to easily access approved claims and manage lecturer information more efficiently. These enhancements improved the overall usability, accuracy, and reliability of the system.
